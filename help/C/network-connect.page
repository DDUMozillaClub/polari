  <title>Connect to an IRC Network</title>
  
    <p>The first time you start <app>Polari</app> you will be asked to join a network.
    Polari comes with over fifty IRC networks configured for you.   Choose the IRC Network
    you would like to connect to and click on it.
    </p>
    
    <p>If you do not see the IRC network you would like to join, you can also enter the details of
    the IRC network.  Click the <gui>Custom Network</gui> button and enter the <gui>Server Address</gui>.
    You can optionally enter the name of the network as you want it to appear in the list of networks
    in the <gui>Network Name</gui> field.
    </p>
    
    <p>After you have connected to an IRC Network, you can connect to other IRC Networks.
