  <title>Use a nickname password on IRC</title>

  <p>On some IRC networks, you can register your nickname with a service called
  NickServ.  By sending special messages to NickServ, you can set your password
  and identify yourself.  Some IRC chat rooms may not allow you to join without
  a registered nickname.</p>

  <p><app>Polari</app> does not currently support nickname registration automatically.
  Every IRC network handles registering a specific nickname differently and you will
  need to check with the IRC network on how to register your nickname.  
  After you have registered a nickname, you will need to message NickServ to identify
  yourself after connecting to the IRC Network with the following command: </p>
  <steps>
    <item>
      <p><input>/msg NickServ identify username password</input></p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Press <key>Enter</key></p>
    </item>
  </steps>
      <note>
        <p>Use the username and password you registered with the IRC network with this
        command.
        </p>
      </note>

  <p><app>Polari</app> will remember your username and password and the next time
  you connect to the IRC network <gui>Polari</gui> will automatically register you
  with the Nickserv service.</p>


  <note>
    <p>These instructions only allow you to use a password-protected nickname
    on certain IRC networks.  It is not currently possible to register an IRC
    nickname or change your nickname password using <app>Polari</app>.</p>
